# Smart Tek test tasks

This repository contains two functions for manipulating data:

## sorted_sequence 

Description: This function takes a list of dimensions as input and sorts them based on their calculated areas. It supports two types of dimensions: rectangles specified by their width and length, and circles specified by their radius. The function calculates the area for each dimension and returns the sorted list based on the calculated areas.

## transform_characters 

Description: This function takes a word as input and rearranges its characters based on specific replacement rules. Vowels are replaced with the nearest left consonant, and consonants are replaced with the nearest right vowel. The function provides a modified version of the word following these rules.
